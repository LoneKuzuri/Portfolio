        <h1>My Story<span className="purple-text">.</span></h1>
        <p>My journey as a front-end developer started back in 2024, working as a <span className="purple-text">freelancer</span> for clients all over the world for several years.</p>
        <p>After being on my own for a while, I decided to enter the corporate world, and I started working as a software developer at <span className="purple-text">Webflow</span>, the same platform I was using with my freelance clients.</p>
        <p>After some exciting months of work at Webflow, I decided to transition to <span className="purple-text">Stripe</span>, where I returned what I love: front-end development. </p>
        <p>My <span className="purple-text">success</span> quickly compounded I started receiving job offers from the biggest names in the industry.</p>
        <p>All these opportunities led me to travel the world. Eventually, however, I decided to settle down for a more calm and simple routine, and I'm now working at Apple. And you know what? I love what I do! ðŸ’œ</p>
